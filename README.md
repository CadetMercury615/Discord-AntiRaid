# Discord-AntiRaid

## Directions
1. Install the Folder
2. Put the 'Anti-Raid' folder somewhere in your bot's directory (make sure to edit the file directories to correspond to your directory)
3. Go to the Config/Config.ts file and make sure you fill in a channel id to be your raid logs channel.
4. Run `npm start` in your Command Line
5. Enjoy a sweet Anti-raid (still in development of course)
